# Pokémon FireRed - Complete Dex Quest

This is a modification of Pokémon FireRed that aims to add all the LeafGreen exclusives, all the missing gen 2 pokémon, every gen 3 pokémon and other species that are otherwise unobtainable in a single playthrough, making it possible to fully complete the National Dex without trading.

Every new species is added to the Sevii Islands and other post-game locations, keeping the main Kanto experience as vanilla as possible. Tickets to the Mystery Gift exclusive event islands will also be made available within the game.

Details about the locations of each new species will be added later.
